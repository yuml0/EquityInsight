# Portfolio Climate Risk Insights for Canadian Equities

## Goal

Build an analytics workflow that turns company + asset‑level data into
portfolio‑level climate risk insights and scenario narratives.

## Build a prototype that:

- Retrieves company and associated asset metrics
- Aggregates to portfolio views (by sector, geography, hazard, horizon)
- Highlights concentration of risk and what‑if scenarios (e.g., heatwave
  frequency increases; fluvial flood risk intensifies)
- Surfaces Top‑N drivers and actionable tilts (e.g., supplier diversification,
  facility adaptation priorities)
- Optionally exposes a natural‑language question interface (e.g., “Which
  holdings drive flood risk in 2035?”)

## Minimum deliverables:

- Reproducible code/notebook + short README
- Example portfolio (ticker list or fabricated sample)
- A 5‑minute demo

## Stretch ideas:

- Interactive dashboard with filters (hazard, horizon, sector)
- Report generator (PDF/HTML) for investor or sustainability audiences
